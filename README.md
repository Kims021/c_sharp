# HackerRank 1-Month Preparation Kit

This repository contains solutions to the problems from the **HackerRank 1-Month Preparation Kit**. I am compiling my solutions here as I work through the challenges on HackerRank to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## About the Preparation Kit

HackerRank's **1-Month Preparation Kit** is designed to help you prepare for coding interviews by covering important algorithms and data structures. It includes a series of practice problems that span various domains such as **Sorting**, **Greedy Algorithms**, **Dynamic Programming**, **Arrays**, **Strings**, **Searching**, and more.

## List of Problems Solved

Here are the problems I have solved as part of the preparation kit:

1. [Plus Minus](#) - Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

2. [Mini-Max Sum](#) - Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

3. [Time Conversion](#) - Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

4. [Sparse Arrays](#) - There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings. Return an array of the results.

5. [Lonely Integer](#) - Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

    Example
    a = [1,2,3,5,3,2,1]
    The unique element is 5.

6. [Flipping Bits](#) - You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits (1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1 ) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

7. [Diagonal Difference](#) - Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

    Example
    3
    11 2 4
    4 5 6
    10 8 -12

    Sample Output: 15

    Explanation

    The primary Diagonal is:
    11   
      5 
       -12
    Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

    The secondary diagonal is:

         4
      5 
    10 

    Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
    Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

    Note: |x| is the absolute value of x

8. [Counting Sort 1](#) - You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits (1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1 ) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

i	arr[i]	result
0	1	[0, 1, 0, 0]
1	1	[0, 2, 0, 0]
2	3	[0, 2, 0, 1]
3	2	[0, 2, 1, 1]
4	1	[0, 3, 1, 1]



    

## Problem Solving Approach

For each problem, I have followed a systematic approach to arrive at an efficient solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Reading the problem description carefully and making sure I understand the input, output, and constraints.
2. **Planning the Approach:** Choosing the appropriate algorithm/data structure to solve the problem, optimizing for time and space complexity where possible.
3. **Writing the Code:** Implementing the solution and making sure it runs correctly.
4. **Testing the Solution:** Running the code against various test cases to ensure it handles edge cases.
